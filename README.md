Information for HTW Students

This is the repository behind my web page,

http://bbergter.github.io/

also available at

http://home.htw-berlin.de/~bergter/

If you find information here that is not (yet) linked from your course's page - especially lab exercises - be aware that I haven't released them yet for the current term, so they might and probably will change at least a bit.

Apart from that, feel free to browse and also send me pull requests if you encounter an error.
